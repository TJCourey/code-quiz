#Description

For this project Icreated a short but effective code quiz on JavaScript. I found this project difficult and ran in to more errors and syntax issues than I have before on any other project. This lead to it feeling even more great when I finally did complete the assignment though. At present, there are only three questions but, as I used arrays for the queestions, answers and answer checker function, it should be easily expandable.
